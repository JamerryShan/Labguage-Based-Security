In the thread post page such as http://localhost:3000/createThread/meta

In the thread's body, use double <script to bypass the filter: 
<script<script>alert('XSS')</script>

Fixing:
We can use a library called XSS to filter the thread.body:
const XSS = require('xss')

thread.body = XSS(thread.body);
